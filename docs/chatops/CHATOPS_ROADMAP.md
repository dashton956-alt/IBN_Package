- [ ] Low risk: 1 approver (network engineer)
- [ ] Medium risk: 2 approvers (engineer + team lead)
- [ ] High risk: 3 approvers (engineer + lead + manager)
- [ ] Critical risk: 4 approvers + change advisory board

**Risk Calculation Rules:**
- [ ] Single device, non-prod VLAN = Low
- [ ] Multiple devices OR prod VLAN = Medium
- [ ] Routing protocol changes = High
- [ ] Core infrastructure changes = High
- [ ] Bulk operations (>10 devices) = Critical
- [ ] Changes during business hours = +1 risk level

3. [ ] Analyze configuration
   - Check if VLAN 50 exists on both devices
   - Found: VLAN 50 missing on leaf03
   
4. [ ] Check logs
   - leaf03 logs: "Interface Ethernet1 down" (5 min ago)
   
5. [ ] Root cause analysis
