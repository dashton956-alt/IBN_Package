# Intent-based Network Automation + AIOps POC Checklist

This file is a single-source checklist and quick-reference for the POC described in the diagram. Use it to track progress and run quick validation commands.

## Summary
- Goal: Build a minimal, secure POC to demonstrate intent-based network automation with AIOps using StackStorm (automation), NetBox (source-of-truth), Gluware (device config), and AnythingLLM (intent parsing / AI ops).
- Scope: Get secure API access, build 3 canonical playbooks (intent â†’ NetBox â†’ Gluware â†’ verify), and add a basic telemetry pipeline for anomaly detection.

## Gap analysis (concise)
- Secrets/credentials: no central secrets store (Vault recommended). ST2 K/V can be used for quick POC.
- Telemetry: no centralized telemetry ingestion (logs/metrics/traces) for AIOps.
- Sandbox/testbed: missing a non-production device group for safe testing.
- Observability: dashboards and correlation not yet defined.
- Pack configuration: `netbox` and `gluware` packs require secure tokens and host configuration inside ST2.

## Concrete integration checklist (commands + examples)
Below are commands you can run from the host. Replace tokens/hosts with real values.

1) Create NetBox API token (via NetBox UI):
- Log into NetBox â†’ your user â†’ Tokens â†’ Add Token (create `st2-service-token`)

2) Configure NetBox pack in StackStorm (example):
```bash
# Run from host, adjust container name if different
docker exec st2-docker-st2client-1 st2 pack config netbox set '
{"hostname":"https://172.30.133.89","api_token":"<NETBOX_TOKEN>","use_https":true,"ssl_verify":false}'
```

3) Configure Gluware pack in StackStorm (example):
```bash
docker exec st2-docker-st2client-1 st2 pack config gluware set '
{"gluware_api":{"url":"https://gluware.example","token":"<GLUWARE_TOKEN>"}}'
```

4) Quick smoke tests:
```bash
# NetBox smoke test
docker exec st2-docker-st2client-1 st2 run netbox.get.dcim.devices limit=1

# Gluware smoke test
docker exec st2-docker-st2client-1 st2 run gluware.gluware.get_device serial="SOME-SERIAL"
```

5) Store secrets in StackStorm K/V (quick POC, not recommended for prod):
```bash
# Example: store a secret (key=netbox_token)
docker exec st2-docker-st2client-1 st2 key set netbox_token --value='<NETBOX_TOKEN>'
```

6) (Optional) Use HashiCorp Vault: deploy Vault and create an ST2 action to fetch secrets in playbooks.


## Minimal canonical playbooks (brief)
- Playbook A â€” Intent: Disable PoE on port:
  1. Parse intent (AnythingLLM or ChatOps) â†’ extract device & port
  2. Verify device in NetBox (inventory lookup)
  3. Generate change plan & dry-run (Gluware) if available
  4. Execute config change via Gluware action
  5. Verify via telemetry/API and update a ticket

- Playbook B â€” Anomaly remediation:
  1. Telemetry pipeline generates alert (e.g., interface error spike)
  2. Trigger ST2 workflow: fetch device info from NetBox
  3. Run diagnostics (ping, show counters via Gluware)
  4. If fixable, apply non-invasive change; otherwise, create ticket and notify ChatOps

- Playbook C â€” Daily drift detection:
  1. Snapshot device config via Gluware
  2. Compare snapshot against NetBox expected config
  3. Report drift and optionally remediate or stub a ticket


## Observability & telemetry (POC recommendation)
- Start small:
  - Syslog â†’ Loki (promtail) â†’ Grafana (dashboards + alerting)
  - Export a few key metrics (interface errors, CPU, memory) to Prometheus
- For logs use Fluentd/Fluentbit or Filebeat to ship logs to an ELK stack or Loki
- Build 2-3 detection rules (thresholds & anomaly) that trigger ST2 workflows


## Next immediate steps (pick one)
1. I can create the `st2 pack config` commands for you and run them here if you paste the NetBox and Gluware tokens (or give me temporary placeholder tokens).
2. I can add a Vault-based secrets example and a sample ST2 action to fetch secrets from Vault.
3. I can scaffold the 3 canonical playbooks into `packs.dev` and register them with StackStorm.

Tell me which one you want me to do now and I'll start it, and I will mark the corresponding checklist items as in-progress and update the file accordingly.
